# SkillIT

-This project is intended to allow the automated download of skills matching a prescribed set of jobs based on a search URL within LinkedIn. Furthermore, the returned data will be in the form of the JobInformationModel via the Extractor as JSON.
-Secondly, there is a parser element to this project which will allow you to load the JSON and parse it so that you get a flattened version of the JobSkillModel as a csv which you can then open in Excel and create a Pivot table from.

# Usage

-In order to use this project you will need to have a LinkedIn account and access to the LinkedIn premium features which enables the skills comparison lookup.
